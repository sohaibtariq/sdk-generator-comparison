## üèó **Welcome to your new SDK!** üèó

It has been generated successfully based on your OpenAPI spec. However, it is not yet ready for production use. Here are some next steps:
- [ ] üõ† Make your SDK feel handcrafted by [customizing it](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/docs/customize-sdks)
- [ ] ‚ôªÔ∏è Refine your SDK quickly by iterating locally with the [Speakeasy CLI](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/speakeasy)
- [ ] üéÅ Publish your SDK to package managers by [configuring automatic publishing](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/docs/productionize-sdks/publish-sdks)
- [ ] ‚ú® When ready to productionize, delete this section from the README

                }})
                .build();

            ListPetsResponse res = sdk.pets.listPets(21453L);

            if (res.pets != null) {
                // handle response

# Development

## Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

## Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically.
Feel free to open a PR or a Github issue as a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release!

### SDK Created by [Speakeasy](https://docs.speakeasyapi.dev/docs/using-speakeasy/client-sdks)
