 * MergeVariableColumnMapping - The mapping of column headers in your file to the merge variables present in your creative. See our &lt;a href="https://help.lob.com/print-and-mail/building-a-mail-strategy/campaign-or-triggered-sends/campaign-audience-guide#step-3-map-merge-variable-data-if-applicable-7" target="_blank"&gt;Campaign Audience Guide&lt;/a&gt; for additional details. &lt;br /&gt;If a merge variable has the same "name" as a "key" in the `requiredAddressColumnMapping` or `optionalAddressColumnMapping` objects, then they **CANNOT** have a different value in this object. If a different value is provided, then when the campaign is processing it will get overwritten with the mapped value present in the `requiredAddressColumnMapping` or `optionalAddressColumnMapping` objects. If using customized QR code redirect from the Audience file, then a `qr_code_redirect_url` must be mapped to the column header as used in the CSV.
